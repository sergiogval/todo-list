# todo-list

In this project, we will build a basic website that allows users to add/remove tasks to  a todo list.
We will use webpack to bundle our code and use a dynamic web server to run the application.
This project has the following features: add/remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, and display all tasks. Also it has a UI that allows users move up and down the list items.
